# NO-ADMIN

## Description:
NO-ADMIN is a simple solution that enables users to install and run programs without requiring administrative rights. It provides a workaround by setting a compatibility layer to run applications with the permissions of the invoking user, thereby bypassing the need for administrative privileges.

## How to Use:
1. Create a new folder on your system.
2. Place the NO-ADMIN script (`no-admin.bat`) in the newly created folder.
3. Put the installation file or the file you want to install (e.g., setup.exe) into the same folder.
4. Rename the installation file to `setup` (all lowercase).
5. Open the `no-admin.bat` file with a text editor like Notepad.
6. Replace `#YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE` with the name of the installation file (`setup`) in the `no-admin.bat` script.
    eg: start setup
8. Save the changes and close the text editor.
9. Now run the BAT file, and it will install.

## Note:
- Ensure that the application you intend to run does not inherently require administrative rights for its functionality.
- Be cautious when installing or running applications from untrusted sources, as bypassing administrative permissions may pose security risks.
- NO-ADMIN is intended for use in scenarios where administrative privileges are not available or restricted, such as on shared or managed computers.
